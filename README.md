# decision-tree-code-for-star-regression.
The code is an implementation of a decision tree regressor that uses the scikit-learn module. The module was trained using a dataset of real observational information about a group of diverse stars. The data set includes features relevant for the prediction of the spectral type of the star, such as color, luminosity, distance, and, of course, type.
