# decision-tree-code-for-star-regression.
the code is an implementation of a decision tree regressor, that uses the sklearn module. The module was trained using a dataset of real observational information about a group of diverse stars. The data set includes features relevant for the prediction of the spectral type of the star, such as color, luminosity, distance and of course type.
